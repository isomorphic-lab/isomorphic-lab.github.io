<h1>Isomorphic</h1>

<p>Isomorphic Labs is an AI research laboratory dedicated to understanding how artificial intelligence systems actually work. While most AI research focuses on building more powerful models, we're focused on opening the "black box", figuring out what's happening inside these systems and why they make the decisions they do.</p> <br>

<p>We use mechanistic interpretability techniques to study AI systems from the inside out. This means we don't just look at inputs and outputs, but dive deep into the internal computations, neural activations, and information processing pathways that drive AI behavior.

Think of it like neuroscience for artificial minds. Just as neuroscientists study brain circuits to understand human cognition, we study the "circuits" in AI systems to understand machine intelligence.
