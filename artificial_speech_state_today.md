## Problem

Adults who lose speech ability after stroke or vocal cord surgery face significant communication barriers. Existing solutions provide poor speech quality and user experience, leading to social isolation and reduced quality of life.

## Our Solution

We are creating **Resonance**, an AI-prosodic generator that translates laryngeal muscle signals into prosodic vibrations. User's mouth and lip movement become filters, transforming these vibrations into audible, natural sounding speech.

## USP of Resonance

1. **Non-invasive** - No surgical procedures required
2. **Gets better with usage** - Adaptive learning improves performance over time
3. **Affordable** - Cost-effective compared to device and surgery costs
4. **Empowers self-expression** - Enables natural communication and social interaction

## Technical Breakdown of Resonance

### i. Sensors
Track muscle movements using mixed materials for optimal signal detection and comfort.

### ii. Neural Network (Edge AI)
Translates muscle signals into phoneme patterns using on-device artificial intelligence for real-time processing.

### iii. Actuator
AI-controlled actuator system for precise prosody generation, creating the foundation for speech synthesis.

### iv. Speech Generation
Mouth and lip movements translate prosody into audible speech, leveraging the user's natural articulation mechanisms for natural-sounding output.
