## Problem

Adults who lose speech ability after stroke or vocal cord surgery face significant communication barriers. Existing solutions provide poor speech quality and user experience, leading to social isolation and reduced quality of life.

## Solution

Create **Resonance**, an AI-prosodic generator that translates laryngeal muscle signals into prosodic vibrations. User's mouth and lip movement become filters, transforming these vibrations into audible, natural sounding speech.

## USP of Resonance

1. **Non-invasive** - No surgical procedures required
2. **Gets better with usage** - Adaptive learning improves performance over time
3. **Affordable** - Cost-effective compared to device and surgery costs
4. **Empowers self-expression** - Enables natural communication and social interaction

## Technical Breakdown of Resonance

### i. Sensors
Track muscle movements using mixed materials for optimal signal detection and comfort.

### ii. Neural Network
Translates muscle signals into phoneme patterns using on-device artificial intelligence for real-time processing.

### iii. Actuator
AI-controlled actuator system for precise prosody generation, creating the foundation for speech synthesis.

### iv. Speech Generation
Mouth and lip movements translate prosody into audible speech, leveraging the user's natural articulation mechanisms for natural-sounding output.


## Why Build It?

### i. Business POV
High CLTV. Customers of existing solution reported 7+ years of usage, paid. In plain english -- loyal customers who will use it till their demise.


### ii. Positioning POV
Not at **center-of-gravity** of BigTech. Except Neuralink. Both Tech & Data wise. Already have distribution-network and Sales pipeline to sell.

### iii. Technical POV
Grounded human-machine interface deployment while maintaining biological autonomy. Real-time unique data generation with usage. Chance to train novel ML Model with limited resource. Opens path to further experiments into vision, hearing, neurodivergence etc. 

### iv. Ego POV
Challenges God & inevitability.


## Stats & Catchup

Atleast 200,000 new laryngectomy userbase generated every year annually (immediate market) with XXMn already living with it. 

30-40% Stroke patients --> Speech Impaired
~ 11Mn new stroke cases annually (70% increase since 1990)

Annual Incidence (else)

● Intubation‑related laryngeal injury	~50% of ICU intubees experience injury

● Tracheostomy complications	Voice-affecting complications in ~20–40% of cases

● Nerve injury in thyroid surgery	0.3–3% transient; up to ~1% permanent

● Voice impact post-head/neck cancer	~50% survivors report dysfunction

● Burns & inhalation injuries	16–60% face long-term vocal effects

● Blunt airway trauma	~0.3–5% incidence in trauma patients

● Stroke-related dysarthria	Affects a large share of ~11 M strokes/year globally
